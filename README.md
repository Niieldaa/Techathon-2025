# 🪶 Etched in Runestone: Ascend to the Throne  
### Techathon 2025 — Jelling (October 24–26)

This project was created in **under 48 hours** during **Techathon 2025** in Jelling, Denmark.  
The event’s main themes were **Bluetooth technology** and **storytelling**, which inspired us to merge **ancient Viking heritage** with **modern VR multiplayer immersion**.

---

## ⚔️ Inspiration  
The guided tours through the **Jelling Museum** gave us deep insight into Viking culture and mythology.  
We wanted to bring those stories to life in a way that’s **interactive**, **immersive**, and **social** — letting players *step into history* and shape their own saga.

## What It Does  
**Etched in Runestone: Ascend to the Throne** is a **1v1 multiplayer VR experience** where players duel for dominance in the heart of ancient Jelling.  

- Compete in **intense Viking battles** using realistic motion and weapon physics.  
- **Carve your name** into the legendary **Jelling Runestone** to claim your throne.  
- Experience an **immersive, family-friendly adventure** that celebrates Danish heritage and Norse myth.  
- Choose your destiny: fight with honor — or **go berserk!**  

Will *you* be the one to sit on the throne?

## 🛠️ How We Built It  
Built with cutting-edge VR technology and a lot of Viking spirit:  

- 🧱 **Unity** — Core game engine  
- 🧩 **C#** — Gameplay scripting  
- 🕹️ **Meta Quest 2 / Quest 3** — VR platform  
- 🌐 **Unity Netcode** — Multiplayer functionality  

---

## ⚙️ Challenges We Faced  
- Implementing **multiplayer** in VR proved tricky — synchronizing interactions and positions was a major hurdle.  
- **Grab interactions** for weapons and objects needed extensive fine-tuning.  
- Rendering complex environments on PCs caused **performance bottlenecks**.  

---

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of  
- Stunning **environment design** that brings Jelling’s historic atmosphere to life.  
- **Chiseling mechanics** that let players carve runes directly into virtual stone.  
- A working **multiplayer system** within 48 hours — no small feat!  

---

## What We Learned  
- Multiplayer in VR is **way harder** than expected — especially with physics-based interactions.  
- Small optimizations make a big difference in **VR performance and comfort**.  
- Combining history, storytelling, and tech can create something truly memorable.

---

## 🔮 What’s Next  
- Expanding multiplayer with **more expressive body tracking** (arms, legs, full-body movement).  
- Adding more complex **rune carving and engraving mechanics** — even longer inscriptions.  
- Refining **network stability** and cross-device compatibility.  
- Exploring **Bluetooth beacon integration** for museum or real-world storytelling experiences.
